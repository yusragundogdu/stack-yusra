# Stack Implementation – Git & GitHub Assignment

This repository contains an implementation of a **Stack** data structure using **Linked Lists**, developed as part of a Git & GitHub classroom assignment.

## 📁 Project Structure

- `ds.py` – Contains the class definitions for:
  - `LLNode`: Node for linked list
  - `LinkedList`: A custom linked list class
  - `Stack`: Implements stack operations using the linked list
- `import_nodes.py` – Defines the `Node` class and a helper function `import_csv()` to read data from `coordinates.csv`
- `coordinates.csv` – A sample CSV file used for importing node data
- `main_LL.py` – Script to test the stack by reading nodes from CSV and pushing/popping them

## 🧪 Stack Methods

- `push(node)` – Adds a node to the top of the stack
- `pop()` – Removes the node from the top
- `peek()` – Returns the node at the top without removing it

## 💻 How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yusragundogdu/stack-yusra.git
   cd stack-yusra

 in commit mesage = python main_LL.py
